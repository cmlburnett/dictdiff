DictDiff -- an interactive dictionary diff class.

Simple class that performs a diff on two dictionaries.
The end result of the diff is a set of instructions neded to be performed to change the dictionaries.
While this may seem excessive, the point is to use the instructions to modify a database.
For example, if two sets of key/value metadata represented as a dictionary were diff'ed
 then this would provide the instructions that could be then performed in a database
 setting to delete, insert, or update rows in the database.
Additionally, the diff is performed in an intereactive manner to permit the user to
 selectively approve or tweak the diff as it is being performed.

There are plenty of enhancements that could be done;
 - Cannot add new keys that are not in the provided dictionaries
 - No type conversions performed on new data
 - Values are assumed to be simple types (int, str, etc.); no nesting supported
