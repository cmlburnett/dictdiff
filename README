DictDiff -- an interactive dictionary diff class.

Simple class that performs a diff on two dictionaries.
The end result of the diff is a set of instructions neded to be performed to change the dictionaries.
While this may seem excessive, the point is to use the instructions to modify a database.
For example, if two sets of key/value metadata represented as a dictionary were diff'ed
 then this would provide the instructions that could be then performed in a database
 setting to delete, insert, or update rows in the database.
Additionally, the diff is performed in an intereactive manner to permit the user to
 selectively approve or tweak the diff as it is being performed.

There are plenty of enhancements that could be done;
 - Cannot add new keys that are not in the provided dictionaries
 - No type conversions performed on new data
 - Values are assumed to be simple types (int, str, etc.); no nesting supported

:Usage:
-------

This class is intended to be a helper class to handle the logic of updating dictionaries as representations of other entities.
In this rough example:
1) a dictionary of metadata is read for a music artist,
2) metadata is then pulled from some source on the internet,
3) diff is performed interactively with user, and
4) changes are applied to the database

	import dictdiff

	# Get metadata
	artist = "Michael Jackson"
	a = ReadMetadata(artist) // Read metadata from the database as a dictionary
	b = FetchMetadata(artist) // Read metadata from the internets

	# Initialize diff
	d = DictDiff(a,b)

	# Do interactive diff
	diff = d.ShowDiff("Update metadata for artist '%s'" % artist)

	# Apply changes
	for row in diff:
		if row[0] == 'd':
			database.execute("delete from `metadata` where `artist`=? and `key`=?", artist, row[1])
		elif row[0] == 'a':
			database.execute("insert into `metadata` (`artist`,`key`,`value`) values(?,?,?)", artist, row[1], row[2])
		elif row[0] == 'k':
			pass
		elif row[1] == 'c':
			database.execute("update `metadata` set `value`=? where `artist`=? and `key`=?", row[2], artist, row[1])
		else:
			raise NotImplementedError
